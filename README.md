## [JenkinsCI](http://jenkins-ci.org/) Simple Upstream Committer Notifier Plugin

Inspired by [Blame Upstream Committers Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Blame+Upstream+Committers+Plugin) - We needed the ability to blame upstream committers without the dependency on artifacts and fingerprints.

This plugin simply crawls the Upstream Build Causes and emails the culprits attached to each of those builds.
